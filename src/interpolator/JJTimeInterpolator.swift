     - Maps a value representing the elapsed fraction of an animation to a value that
       represents the interpolated fraction. this interpolated value is then multiplied
       by the change in value of an animation to derive the animated value at the current
       animation time.

     - Parameters:
      - input: A value between 0 and 1.0 indicating our current point
        in the animation where 0 represent the start and 1.0 represents
        the end.
    
     - return: The interpolation value. this value can be more than 1.0 for interpolators
       which overshoot their targets, or less that 0 for interpolators that undershoot
       their targets.
